# SafePlaces Authentication

## Overview

The [SafePlaces Auth Library](https://github.com/Path-Check/safeplaces-auth) contains all functionality related to user authentication. Under the hood, the auth library interfaces with [Auth0](https://auth0.com/). Auth0 provides authentication as a service and offers the ability to integrate with a [number of identity providers](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/identity-providers-enterprise). At this time, SafePlaces does not support any authentication strategies beyond what Auth0 allows.

In-depth documentation pertaining to authenication can be found within the [SafePlaces Auth Library Repo](https://github.com/Path-Check/safeplaces-auth/tree/master/docs).
